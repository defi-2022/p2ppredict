A maker creates markets


what a maker needs to do:
  choose:
    - asset
    - strike
    - expiry
    - collateral


what can be useful for a maker to see:
  - chart for the chosen asset
  - percentage rise necessary to hit strike (total and per day)
  - countdown to expiry
  - similar positions already existing


when all above is done:
maker has to choose if they wanna:
    - create and list
    - only create

if both:
  maker needs to choose:
  - side
  - odds

if only create:
  - create market, give a link to open positions page
