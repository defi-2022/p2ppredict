LISTEN ON PREDICTIONMARKET FOR CREATED MARKETS
- save markets and predictions

LISTEN ON EXCHANGE FOR ASKS:
- save asks



I want to show all markets on the screen
1. send req to /markets
2. send req to /asks
3. compare collateral with ask value -> ODDS


market = {
  priceFeed,
  strikePrice,
  expiry,
  collateral,
  overPredictionId,
  underPredictionId,
}

market -> 2x prediction = {
  priceFeed,
  strikePrice,
  expiry,
  collateral,
  over,
}

ask = {
  tokenId,
  price,
}

ask connects to market via predictionId
odds = collateral / price
