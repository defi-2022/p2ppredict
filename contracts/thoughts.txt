maker:


A maker can:
- create a market
  - 2-way


when a market is created:
  - the maker receives two NFTs
    - over side
    - under side


Example:
Bob creates a market:
  asset: SOL
  strike: $30
  expiry: 2023-01-01

with collateral:
  asset: ETH
  amount: 1

Bob sell the UNDER NFT to Alice:
  price: 0.25 ETH

under odds = collateral / price = 1 / 0.25 = 4.00
over odds = collateral / price = 1 / 0.75 = 1.3333333333

at 2023-01-01 and price is $32 -> Bob wins
  - he receives


Market1 = {
  ETH
  $1000 in 10D
  2.00
  0.01 ETH
}

Prediction1 = {
  Market1
  over
}


-> market

-> makerAsk

get all markets? /markets
get markets by id? /markets/:marketId
get markets for asset? /markets?asset


marketId = {
  market
  over: [
    makerAsks...
  ]
  under: [
    makerAsks...
  ]
}
